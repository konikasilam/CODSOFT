Task 1
TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
In this step 1 is to  processed the data which involve handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical variables, and scaling the data.
after processing step 2 is the train test split by spliting the data into 80-20% for better accuracy of our model step 3 is to train a machine learning model using LogisticRegression then Evaluate the model on the testing set. This will give us an idea of how well the model will generalize to unseen data.
Once we are satisfied with the performance of the model, we can use it to predict the survival of passengers in the test set.
Some of the key findings of Titanic dataset theory include:
Women were more likely to survive than men.
Children were more likely to survive than adults.
Passengers in first class were more likely to survive than passengers in second or third class.
Passengers with family members on board were more likely to survive than passengers without family members on board.
The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for machine learning and data analysis because it is relatively small and easy to understand, but it still contains enough complexity to make it a challenging task to predict passenger survival. 


Task 2
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
The Iris flower classification model is a classic machine learning problem that involves classifying three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their sepal and petal length and width. The model is trained on a dataset of 150 flowers, with 50 flowers from each species.
There are many different machine learning models that can be used for the Iris flower classification problem. here we have use Logistic regression .this model
can accurately classify the iris flowers into their respective species from the flower measurements


Task 3
SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
Here we have use Advertising data set and,
we have demonstrated in detail how to apply linear regression using stats model for predicting sales from advertising data. By carefully selecting the right variables, and by preparing and cleaning the data, and selecting an appropriate regression model, businesses can accurately predict sales from advertising ads.
Advertising datasets can be a valuable resource for businesses of all sizes. By carefully analyzing advertising datasets, businesses can improve the performance
